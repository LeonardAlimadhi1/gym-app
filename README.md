# React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
This setup provides lightning-fast cold server start, hot module replacement (HMR), and near-instantaneous rebuilds, enhancing productivity and reducing development cycle times.


Key Features:

•	React Framework: Utilizes the React library for building efficient and reusable user interfaces.

•	Tailwind CSS: Integrates Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, enabling the creation of sleek, responsive designs.

• Designs compatible for both desktop and mobile.


Usage:

1.	Clone the repository to your local machine: "git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git"

2.	Navigate to the project directory: "cd project-directory"

3.	Install dependencies: "npm install"

4.	Start the development server: "npm run dev"

5.  Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
